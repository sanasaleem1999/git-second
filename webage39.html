            <h3> POETRY FOR KIDS</h3>
            <p class="first">
             Poetry for children captures the essence of childhood: the fun, the laughter, the hope,</br>
             and the inquisitive nature of exploring their world. Exposing kids to poetry </br>early is a great
            way to build reading skills and a love for poetry. Children will learn new</br> words, practice reading 
             aloud with expression, and be exposed to rhymes.</br>
             Children's poetry makes reading fun, which will ignite a passion for the spoken and written word.

         <h3>POEMS ABOUT LIFE</h3>
            <p class="second">
                 We are the sum of experiences that we encounter as we go through life.</br> 
                 Day to day struggles and triumphs are experienced by all of the world's creatures.</br> 
                 As human beings, when we encounter a challenge, </br>we have freedom to choose how to react.</br>
                Every decision that we make leads us down a different road. We will never come to exactly </br>
                 the same crossroads. Every decision that we make has significance.  </p>

                <h3> POEMS ABOUT COMPASSION</h3>
                <p class="only">
                        When we feel strong and well, it is easy to forget about our own frailties 
                        and also the misfortunes, troubles, and sicknesses of others. We are only as
                         strong as is our compassion for those who are weak. For in strength must come
                          the power of understanding and the wisdom to act with gentleness and kind concern 
                          for those who are not able to help themselves. It is in the ability to empathize that 
                          we show true insight and in the ability to aid that we show our real gifts. These are
                           the real hallmarks of true compassion and strength.

                            <p class="xor">   Knowing when to start a new paragraph in a novel or short story should be a simple matter,
                                 but for many writers–especially beginning writers–it’s anything but. Like most
                                  aspects of writing,
                                  when it comes to paragraphs, there are rules, and then there are 
                                  interpretations of the rules. So there’s
                                   definitely some room for flexibility here. To keep things simple,
                                    let’s start 
                                with a few basic rules and then look at how you can stretch, bend or break 
                                them to your liking. Whenever you skip forward or backward in time or move
                                 from one location to another, start a new paragraph. Going back to our haunted
                                 
                                 house example, if the action starts outside the house, begin a new paragraph as
                                  soon as the action moves inside. Alternatively, if you move from the protagonist’s 
                                  impressions of the present moment to an incident in his past when he faced a similar
                                   challenge, begin a new paragraph.

                                    Sometimes starting a new paragraph or allowing a single sentence to stand on its own
                                     is a great way to emphasize a key point, get a laugh, or otherwise control the pace 
                                     of the story to your advantage. A word to the wise though: This technique will only
                                      produce a dramatic effect if used sparingly.
